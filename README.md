Hi ðŸ‘‹ My name is Robert Hartley
===============================

I graduated with a First class Master's degree in Physics from the University of Manchester in 2024. Currently, I am actively seeking graduate data science opportunities. With my passion for data-driven decision-making, I am excited to apply my strong theoretical background in statistics to real-world scenarios.
